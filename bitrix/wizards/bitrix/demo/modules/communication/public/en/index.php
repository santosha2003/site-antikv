modules that you can use to create different types of communications.</p>

on events, create communities, write comments to other users and more.</p>

	<p>The <b>Helpdesk</b> module helps to build the hot line to assist clients
	in using software, devices or in any other sphere to which your web site is
	devoted.</p>

	users' opinions on different questions. As an example, the demo site creates
