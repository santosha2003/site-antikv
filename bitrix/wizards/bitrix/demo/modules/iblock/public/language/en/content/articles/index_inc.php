This page displays articles - information block elements of the <b>Articles</b>
type. Articles are published using the <b>News Section </b>composite component
with the selected information block <b>Articles</b>. The tag <b>&lt;break&nbsp;/&gt;</b>
was used in each article to split them in pages. In the public section, an
article will be rendered in several pages, depending on how the <b>&lt;break&nbsp;/&gt;</b>
tags are added.
